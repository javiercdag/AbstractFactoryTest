# AbstractFactoryTest
Abstract Factory Java test project

Objective: the implementation of this program was made with the idea of implementing the Abstract Factory design pattern into a multithreaded environment.
The program asks the user for the amount of bicicles they want in a road race, each of the bicicles being a thread; then repeats the same
procedure but to initiate an off-track race, where the bycicles have a higher chance of dropping from the race mid-way through it.

Compiling : this project was conceived as a Netbeans project, and its folder tree is designed for it. However, it can
also be compiled from the command line as there are no Netbeans' specific libraries involved.
